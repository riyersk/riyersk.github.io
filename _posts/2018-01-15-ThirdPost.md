title: Pipe Dream Project Idea
---

At Metis, the last project we do is a passion project and it's very open ended, so I've been trying to come up with ideas for it. I came up with an idea that might not be realistic for a passion project, but it's interesting enough that I thought I'd write about it here to potentially come back to it later.

Before Metis, I worked as a Technical Advisor at an intellectual property law firm doing patent prosecution work.  The vast majority of my job consisted of replying to office actions on patent applications.  To give some background, when a client wants a patent on an invention, they'll have a patent application prepared and sent to the patent office.  The patent office will look over the application and often, an examiner will respond with one or more rejections.  These rejections usually have one of three flavors:
  35 U.S.C. 101: The Examiner claims that the application is directed toward ineligible subject matter.
  35 U.S.C. 102: The Examiner claims that the claimed invention has been invented before.
  35 U.S.C. 103: The Examiner claims that all the parts of the claimed invention had been invented before, and that it would have been obvious to somebody skilled in the art to combine them in such a way so as to achieve the claimed invention.
  
My job, in a nutshell, was to look over the rejections, the applications, and the relevent files, and write a response arguing against the Examiners position, or, if necessary, amending the claimed invention to overcome the rejection(s).

What if data science could automate this, at least to an extent?  What if, using NLP techniques, I could collect many applictions, office actions, and art documents, and use a deep learning model to determine the best way to respond to an office action?

The reason I call this a pipe dream and say that it's probably not realistic as a passion project is because the amount of data needed to build such a model with an acceptable performance would probably be massive.  Still, one can always come back to dreams later.
