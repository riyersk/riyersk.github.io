title: Reflection on week 1 at Metis
---

Last week, on Monday the 8th, I started at Metis, a data science bootcamp.  Today, I would like to reflect on that week.

We were given a group project on Monday and it was due with a presentation on Friday. On its face, that sounds pretty intense, and sure, it was.  However, leaving aside the project, the pace of the bootcamp so far has been a little slow.  At the start of each lecture last week, we were given one or two programming exercises of the sort you might be given at an interview.  In my view, if you want to give this as a warm up exercise, fine, but this should not take more than half an hour.  However, we were spending 2 to 3 hours on this by the end of the week.  This is not an efficient use of time.

Additionally, much of what we covered this week could have been relegated to prework (work that we did prior to day 1 of the bootcamp):
        Day 1: The main lectures today were on git and pandas.  Git was covered in the prework.  Yes, the lecture went a little more in depth, but additional information could have been provided in the prework as well.  Same with pandas.  If the python notebook companion had been available as part of the prework, I could have covered this material myself before the bootcamp much more quickly, and then at the start of the bootcamp we could have focused more on the project.
        Day 2: Command line, matplotlib, and seaborn.  Same thoughts as above.
        Day 3: Blog walkthrough:  I don't actually have too many complaints about this day.  We were shown how to create this blog, which I think would have been difficult on my own.  Additionally, we were given most of the day for working on our project, which was appreciated.
        Day 4: Main lecture today was on our daily git workflow.  If Metis has a reason for insisting that git not be covered solely in the prework, but also during week 1, then this should have been done day 1, when the lecture on git happened.
        Day 5: Presentations: No complaints.

My suspicion is that for the first week, the instructors had a little flexibility with what they lectured on, and that most of the time was to be spent on the project.  However, I would have preferred if the course material for this week had been given as part of the prework, and that our mastery of it could have been tested with various exercises, perhaps on hackerrank.  That being said, I thought having a project presentation due the first week was a good thing.  We've become oriented toward projects and deliverables, which seems to be reflective of how life as a professional data scientist will be.  On the whole, I think the spirit of having the first week be project focused is a good one, but if that's the route Metis wants to take, it should take it all the way.
